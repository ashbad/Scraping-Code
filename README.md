# Scraping-Code
Java code to scrap data for web scraping
This is partially completed code as I have not worked on web scrapping concept in my previous projects so tried my best after reffering 
google to atleast have hands on it...
#Code Logic
 Here, I have created a author filter for screening the author objects(/elements) and after getting the data from the Html content 
 creating list of the authors found in the article.
 Again, I have reffered sites how to scrap text/name form HTML content..(Might be incorrect also)
